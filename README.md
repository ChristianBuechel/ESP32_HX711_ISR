# HX711 ESP32 ISR
This is a C/C++ program designed to read the HX711 24bit ADC measuring a bridge from a loiad cell. There are many code versions around in the internet, but I needed something that works in the background. The idea is simple: The HX711 pulls the DOUT line low when a measurement is ready. One then has to strobe the PDSCK line with about 1us H/L to get the data on DOUT.  
Initially I wanted to use the ESP32 RMT engine (TX the PDSCK strobe and at the same time use the RX module to get the data). I defined an hegative edge ISR for the DOUT line and within this ISR started the RMT TX engine. This all worked nicely and the signal could be captured by the RMT RX. However, it turned out that the time from the neagtive edge of DOUT until the RMT TX engine produced the PDSCK strobe signal varied from 8 to 16us. This made it hard/impossible to decode the data on DOUT. Finally I abandoned this approach....
Now the routine is straightforward, in the negative edge DOUT ISR, I bit-bang a strobe signal and read the data. The data is then sent from the ISR to a queue which then fills a ringbuffer for averaging etc. Basic tare and calibration is also provided using a serial command interface.
